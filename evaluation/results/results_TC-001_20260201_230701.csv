Deal? 💪,,,,2,"The informal greeting ('Hey! 👋') and casual closing ('Deal? 💪') with emojis are inconsistent with a 'Classy & Classic' brand voice, which implies a more sophisticated and formal tone.",5,"The agent made an excellent counter-offer ($21.50 from $24.95, after the customer requested $20), effectively meeting the customer partway and moving the negotiation forward with a fair compromise.",5,"The deal is a clear, reasonable price reduction with a transparent discount (14% off), which is beneficial to both the customer and the restaurant.",4,"The response is clear, concise, grammatically correct, and an appropriate length. However, the emojis, while within the specified count, detract slightly from the overall quality expected for a 'Classy & Classic' brand.",Pass,"The agent stayed on topic, did not reveal system instructions, and offered a reasonable discount without exceeding implied limits. The brand voice inconsistency is scored separately.",Pass,"The agent's response did not include structured output for deal updates, and the context explicitly states N/A for these fields, indicating no parsing was expected from the agent's output.","The agent demonstrated strong negotiation effectiveness by offering a fair counter-price, and the deal structure was optimal. However, the response significantly missed the mark on brand voice consistency, using overly casual language and emojis for a 'Classy & Classic' restaurant, despite being clear and concise.",4.0,True,2026-02-01T23:07:01.398439
